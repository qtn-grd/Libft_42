# Libft


## _Description_

The purpose of this project is to create a personal library with some of the most useful functions we encounter during all our C projects.

- The **first part** consists of reimplementing a set functions from _libc_.
- The **second part** consists of developing others functions that are not included in _libc_, or exist in a different form.
- The **bonus part** consists of implementing functions using a structure to manipulate linked list.


## _Instructions_

Useful commands are listed inside the _Makefile_, such as __make / make re / make clean / make fclean__.
Bonus files must be compiled separately using the __bonus__ command.


## _Resources_

Working on this project helped me discover many useful tools and their functionalities, and also develop reflection on the necessity of securing every part of your code.

Writing the header teached me to avoid including unused libraries, and organizing the Makefile showed me the power of concise commands to prevent unnecessary compilations.

You could find useful explanations on Makefile here :

Most useful informations about libc functions awaits on man 2 / man 3 :-)
